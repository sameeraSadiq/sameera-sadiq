    My favourite Git command
<br>
    The "git status -s" command is used in Git to display a concise and easy-to-read summary of the current status of your working directory and staging area. Here's what it does:
    * It lists out the changes to the files in the repository.
    * Files that are staged for commit are displayed with M, A, or D characters representing modifications, additions, or deletions.
    * Files that are not staged for commit or untracked are displayed with a ??.

    This command is handy for quickly checking the status of your files and seeing which ones have been modified, staged, or are untracked in your Git repository.

    example
     "index.html" has been modified (M).
     "logo.png" is a new file that has been added to the staging area (A).
     "new_file.txt" is an untracked file in the working directory (??).
     This simple and concise output from "git status -s" gives you a quick overview of the status of your files in the Git repository.
